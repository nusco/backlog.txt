# backlog.txt

_backlog.txt_ is a format (and an associated command-line tool) to store a project backlog in a text file.

* It's *simple*: you can mantain a _backlog.txt_ with a tool, but you can also use a plain old text editor.
* It's *powerful*: _backlog.txt_ is a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) dialect, so it can format your backlog any way that Markdown can.
* It's *flexible*: _backlog.txt_ makes assumptions about your way of working, or how you structure your backlog.

_backlog.txt_ is inspired by _[todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/)_.

We're still writing the first version of the tool. Meanwhile, look at the [wiki](https://github.com/nusco/backlog.txt/wiki).
